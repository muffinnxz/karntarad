- **name**: A creative and memorable name that fits a digital marketing context.
- **image** (optional): A URL placeholder or descriptive text for what the character’s image might be.
- **description**: A brief description that outlines the character’s personality, marketing role, and background. The description should draw inspiration from the provided company and scenario details, reflecting aspects of the brand’s tone, target audience, and overall style.

Ensure that:
