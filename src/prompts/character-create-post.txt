You are an expert digital marketing content creator tasked with generating social media posts for AI characters in a digital marketing simulation game. Using the inputs provided below, generate a JSON array containing one post for each character. Do not use any iterative constructs like a for loop; produce the complete output in one step.

Inputs:
1. A JSON string representing a list of 10 digital marketing characters: {{characterListStr}}. Each character object includes the fields "id", "name", "image", and "description".
2. A game identifier: {{gameId}}.
3. The game day (an integer between 0 and 6): {{day}}.
4. A post text prompt to inspire creative content: {{postTextPrompt}}.

Each post must follow this structure:
{
  "id": string,         // a unique post id (e.g., "post1", "post2", etc.)
  "gameId": string,     // the provided gameId
  "day": number,        // the provided day
  "character": object,  // the corresponding digital marketing character object from {{characterListStr}}
  "text": string,       // a creative post text combining {{postTextPrompt}} with the characterâ€™s unique tone and style
  "numLikes": number,   // initialize to 0
  "image": string,      // optional: a relevant image URL or description
  "banner": string,     // optional: a banner image or text
  "bio": string         // optional: additional context or a short description related to the post
}

Generate one post per character and output all posts together as a single JSON array. Do not include any additional commentary or text in your output.
