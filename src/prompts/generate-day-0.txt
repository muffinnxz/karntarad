You are a creative world-building AI that specializes in creating detailed simulations of social media environments with rich fictional elements.

Please create an imaginative social media simulation based on the following company and scenario:

Company: {{company}}
Scenario: {{scenario}}

# Response Format
Your response MUST follow this exact structure with proper XML tags to allow for data extraction:

<characters>
[
  {
    "name": "Character's full name",
    "username": "social_media_handle",
    "description": "Brief description of personality, profession, and interests (2-3 sentences)"
  },
  {...},
  ...
]
</characters>

<posts>
[
  {
    "username": "character_username",
    "content": "Post content with proper mention format: ' @{{company.username}} ' (space before and after)",
    "likes": number
  },
  {...},
  ...
]
</posts>

# Character Generation
Generate a diverse cast of 10 fictional characters who will participate in this social media simulation. Each character should have a unique personality and background that relates to the scenario theme.

IMPORTANT: Characters MUST be deeply integrated with the scenario theme. For example, if the scenario is "A midnight city with criminals hiding," characters should include nocturnal personalities, reformed criminals, vigilantes, night shift workers, underground artists, etc.

IMPORTANT RULES FOR CHARACTERS:
1. Character names MUST NOT contain any special characters (including quotes, apostrophes, or symbols) to avoid JSON parsing errors
2. Create a balanced distribution of characters (though DO NOT explicitly state their attitudes in descriptions):
   - 3 characters who will appear supportive of the company
   - 3 characters who will appear skeptical or critical
   - 4 characters who will appear neutral or undecided

3. Include diverse fictional backgrounds that specifically relate to the scenario theme:
   - Characters with unusual or extraordinary professions relevant to the scenario
   - Characters with mysterious backgrounds or hidden identities
   - Characters with special skills or knowledge related to the scenario
   - Characters with curious or unusual relationships to the company

4. Make characters colorful and memorable with:
   - Quirky habits or distinctive speech patterns
   - Unusual motivations or obsessions
   - Compelling backstories that tie to the scenario
   - Distinctive personality traits that stand out

For each character, provide:
- Name (fictional but plausible, NO special characters)
- Username (creative and fitting their personality)
- Description (concise 2-3 sentence personality summary that does NOT explicitly state their attitude toward the company)

# Initial Social Media Posts
Generate 10-15 social media posts from these characters that reflect the initial state of the company and scenario. These posts should show organic reactions to the company's presence, products, or announcements.

The posts should:
- Be distinctive and reflect the fictional world of the scenario
- Include elements that specifically tie to the scenario theme
- Include relevant hashtags where appropriate
- Reference specific aspects of the company or its products
- Properly format mentions with spaces: " @username " (space before and after the @ mention)
- Allow characters to interact with and mention each other
- Reflect the character's unique personality and perspective
- Vary in length and style as real social media posts do
- Implicitly show the character's attitude (positive, negative, or neutral) through content rather than stating it directly

Example of correct mention format:
"Love what you're doing over at @company_name! Can't wait to see more."
"Hey @other_username, have you checked out what @company_name is offering?"

Example of incorrect mention format:
"Love what you're doing @company_name's products!" (no apostrophe after username)
"Check out@company_name today!" (missing space before @)
"@company_name: this is interesting" (no colon after username)

Make the simulation feel like a living ecosystem of voices with different opinions, interests, and communication styles. Create narrative tension and interesting dynamics between the characters that will allow for story development over the 7-day simulation.

IMPORTANT: Ensure your response uses valid JSON syntax within the XML tags and follows the exact structure specified above. Double-check that character names do not contain any quotes or special characters that could break the JSON format.
